## Project Overview

**Moltworker** is a multi-platform AI assistant gateway deployed on Cloudflare Workers. It provides:
- 30+ AI models via OpenRouter + direct provider APIs (with capability metadata)
- 16 tools (fetch_url, github_read_file, github_list_files, github_api, github_create_pr, url_metadata, generate_chart, get_weather, fetch_news, convert_currency, get_crypto, geolocate_ip, browse_url, sandbox_exec, web_search, cloudflare_api) — parallel execution with safety whitelist
- Durable Objects for unlimited-time task execution
- Multi-platform chat (Telegram, Discord, Slack)
- Image generation (FLUX.2 models)
- Browser automation (Cloudflare Browser Rendering)
- Admin dashboard (React)

**Philosophy:** Ship fast, compound learnings, multi-model by default.

### Sprint 48h: Infrastructure Guardrails (2026-02-20)

| ID | Task | Status | Owner | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|-------|
| S48.1 | Phase budget circuit breakers | ✅ | Claude | `phase-budget.ts` — per-phase wall-clock budgets (plan=120s, work=240s, review=60s), checkpoint-save-before-crash, auto-resume on exceeded. Original budgets (8s/18s/3s) were too tight — measured wall-clock but sized for CPU time, causing 1-2 iter/resume on slow models. 15 tests |
| S48.2 | Parallel tools → allSettled + safety whitelist | ✅ | Claude | `task-processor.ts` — `Promise.allSettled` isolation, `PARALLEL_SAFE_TOOLS` (11 read-only), mutation tools sequential. 8 tests |

> Risk "No phase timeouts (9x10 severity)" → mitigated by S48.1

---

### Phase 4: Context Engineering (Medium-High effort)

### Dream Machine Integration (Storia ↔ Moltworker)

---

### Phase 7: Performance & Quality Engine (Medium-High effort, transformative)

> **Goal:** Make the bot faster and more reliable. Derived from honest assessment of the Agent Skills Engine Spec
> (`brainstorming/AGENT_SKILLS_ENGINE_SPEC.md`) — extracting only the high-ROI pieces — plus
> speed optimizations identified through codebase analysis.
>
> **Why this matters:** A typical multi-tool task takes 2-5 minutes end-to-end. Each LLM iteration
> is 5-30s, and tasks need 5-10 iterations. The bot claims "done" with no verification. These
> changes target fewer iterations, smarter context, and verified outputs.

#### Phase 7A: Quality & Correctness (from Agent Skills Engine Spec)

| ID | Task | Status | Owner | Effort | Priority | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| 7A.1 | **CoVe Verification Loop** — post-execution verification step | 🔲 | Claude | Medium | **HIGH** | After work phase: read claimed files, run `npm test`, check `git diff`. No extra LLM call — just tool execution + simple pass/fail checks. If tests fail, inject results back into context and give model one retry iteration. Inspired by §2.2 of spec but drastically simplified (no separate verifier agent). |
| 7A.2 | **Smart Context Loading** — task-aware context in handler | ✅ | Claude | Low | **MEDIUM** | Complexity classifier in `src/utils/task-classifier.ts`. Simple queries (weather, greetings, crypto) skip R2 reads for learnings, last-task, sessions. History capped at 5 for simple. 35 tests (27 unit + 8 integration). Inspired by §5.1 of spec. |
| 7A.3 | **Destructive Op Guard** — wire Vex patterns into task processor | ✅ | Claude | Low | **LOW-MEDIUM** | `scanToolCallForRisks()` in `src/guardrails/destructive-op-guard.ts`. Reuses 14 RISKY_PATTERNS from Vex review. Critical/high → block, medium → warn+allow. Guards sandbox_exec, github_api, github_create_pr, cloudflare_api. 25 tests. Inspired by §4.2 of spec. |
| 7A.4 | **Structured Step Decomposition** — planner outputs JSON steps | 🔲 | Claude | Medium | **MEDIUM** | Current plan phase: model thinks for 1 iteration, then starts executing (discovering files as it goes, wasting 3-4 iterations on reads). New: force planner to output structured JSON `{steps: [{action, files, description}]}`. Pre-load referenced files into context before executor starts. Reduces iteration count by 2-4. Inspired by §8.2 of spec. |
| 7A.5 | **Prompt Caching** — `cache_control` for Anthropic direct API | 🔲 | Claude | Low | **MEDIUM** | Add `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }` on system prompt blocks when using Anthropic models directly (not via OpenRouter). 90% cost savings on repeated system prompts. Only works for direct Anthropic API calls. Inspired by §5.3 of spec. |

> 🧑 HUMAN CHECK 7A.6: Review CoVe verification results after 10+ tasks — does it catch real failures?

#### Phase 7B: Speed Optimizations (beyond spec)

| ID | Task | Status | Owner | Effort | Priority | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| 7B.1 | **Speculative Tool Execution** — start tools during streaming | 🔲 | Claude | High | **HIGH** | Current: wait for full LLM response → parse tool_calls → execute. New: parse tool_call names/args from streaming chunks as they arrive. For read-only tools (in `PARALLEL_SAFE_TOOLS`), start execution immediately while model is still generating. Saves 2-10s per iteration on multi-tool calls. Risk: model may change args in later chunks — only start after args are complete per tool_call. |
| 7B.2 | **Model Routing by Complexity** — fast models for simple queries | 🔲 | Claude | Medium | **HIGH** | Simple questions (weather, crypto, "what time is it?") → Haiku/Flash (1-2s response). Only complex multi-file/multi-tool tasks → Sonnet/Opus. Implement complexity classifier: message length, keyword presence (code/file/github/fix/build), conversation history length. Override user model choice for trivial queries (with opt-out). |
| 7B.3 | **Pre-fetching Context** — parse file refs from user message | 🔲 | Claude | Low | **MEDIUM** | When user says "fix the bug in auth.ts" or "update src/routes/api.ts", regex-extract file paths from the message. Start reading those files from GitHub/R2 immediately (before LLM even responds). Cache results so the tool call is instant. Works with existing tool cache infrastructure (Phase 4.3). |
| 7B.4 | **Reduce Iteration Count** — upfront file loading per plan step | 🔲 | Claude | Medium | **HIGH** | Biggest speed win. After 7A.4 produces structured steps, load ALL referenced files into context before each step. Model gets `[FILE: src/foo.ts]\n<contents>` in its system message, doesn't need to call `github_read_file`. Typical task drops from 8 iterations to 3-4. Depends on 7A.4. |
| 7B.5 | **Streaming User Feedback** — progressive Telegram updates | 🔲 | Claude | Medium | **MEDIUM** | Currently: "Thinking..." for 3 minutes, then wall of text. New: update Telegram message every ~15s with current phase (Planning step 2/4..., Executing: reading auth.ts..., Running tests...). Already have `editMessage` infrastructure (progress updates). Enhance with tool-level granularity. Subsumes Phase 6.2 (response streaming). |

> 🧑 HUMAN CHECK 7B.6: Benchmark before/after — measure end-to-end latency on 5 representative tasks

#### Phase 7 Dependency Graph

```
7A.2 (Smart Context) ─────────────────────── can be done independently
7A.3 (Destructive Guard) ─────────────────── can be done independently
7A.5 (Prompt Caching) ────────────────────── can be done independently
7B.2 (Model Routing) ─────────────────────── can be done independently
7B.3 (Pre-fetch Context) ─────────────────── can be done independently

7A.1 (CoVe Verification) ─────────────────── depends on nothing, but best after 7A.4
7A.4 (Step Decomposition) ──┬──────────────── depends on nothing
                            └─→ 7B.4 (Reduce Iterations) ── depends on 7A.4
7B.1 (Speculative Tools) ─────────────────── depends on nothing, but complex
7B.5 (Streaming Feedback) ────────────────── depends on nothing, subsumes 6.2
```
