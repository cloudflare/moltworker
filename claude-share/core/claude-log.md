## Session: 2026-02-07 | Phase 0: Quick Model Catalog Wins (Session: 011qMKSadt2zPFgn2GdTTyxH)

**AI:** Claude Opus 4.6
**Branch:** `claude/analyze-tool-calling-5ee5w`
**Status:** Completed

### Summary
Completed Phase 0 quick wins: added 3 new models to the catalog (Pony Alpha, GPT-OSS-120B, GLM 4.7). Task 0.1 (Gemini Flash tools) was already done on main from a previous PR. All models verified on OpenRouter, deployed successfully.

### Changes Made
1. Added `pony` — OpenRouter Pony Alpha (free, 200K context, coding/agentic/reasoning, tools)
2. Added `gptoss` — OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B free tier (117B MoE, native tool use)
3. Added `glm47` — Z.AI GLM 4.7 ($0.07/$0.40, 200K context, multi-step agent tasks)
4. Set up private companion repo with all orchestration docs
5. Updated CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .gitignore for public repo

### Files Modified
- `src/openrouter/models.ts` (3 new model entries)
- `.gitignore` (added claude-share/ exclusion)
- `CLAUDE.md` (new)
- `AGENTS.md` (updated)

### Tests
- [x] All 82 tests pass
- [ ] Typecheck has pre-existing errors (not from our changes)

### Notes for Next Session
- Phase 0 complete. Move to Phase 1.1: Parallel tool execution
- See `next_prompt.md` for ready-to-copy task prompt
- Pre-existing typecheck errors in `task-processor.ts` and `telegram/handler.ts` need attention

## Session: 2026-02-06 | Multi-AI Orchestration & Tool-Calling Analysis (Session: 011qMKSadt2zPFgn2GdTTyxH)

**AI:** Claude Opus 4.6
**Branch:** `claude/analyze-tool-calling-5ee5w`
**Status:** Completed

### Summary
Created comprehensive tool-calling landscape analysis and multi-AI orchestration documentation structure. Analyzed three external projects (steipete ecosystem, Acontext, Compound Engineering Plugin) for applicability to Moltworker. Identified 10 architectural gaps and produced 13 actionable recommendations across 6 phases.

### Changes Made
1. Created `brainstorming/tool-calling-analysis.md` — Full analysis (475 lines)
   - steipete ecosystem analysis (mcporter, Peekaboo, CodexBar, oracle)
   - Acontext context data platform analysis
   - Compound Engineering Plugin analysis
   - OpenRouter tool-calling model landscape
   - 10 gaps identified, 13 recommendations, priority matrix
2. Created multi-AI orchestration documentation structure:
   - `claude-share/core/SYNC_CHECKLIST.md`
   - `claude-share/core/GLOBAL_ROADMAP.md`
   - `claude-share/core/WORK_STATUS.md`
   - `claude-share/core/next_prompt.md`
   - `claude-share/core/AI_CODE_STANDARDS.md`
   - `claude-share/core/SPECIFICATION.md`
   - `claude-share/core/claude-log.md` (this file)
   - `claude-share/core/codex-log.md`
   - `claude-share/core/bot-log.md`
3. Created `CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code project instructions
4. Updated `AGENTS.md` — Added multi-agent coordination section

### Files Modified
- `brainstorming/tool-calling-analysis.md` (new)
- `claude-share/core/*.md` (all new, 9 files)
- `CLAUDE.md` (new)
- `AGENTS.md` (updated)

### Tests
- [x] No code changes, documentation only
- [x] Existing tests unaffected

### Notes for Next Session
- Start with Phase 0 quick wins (tasks 0.1-0.3 in GLOBAL_ROADMAP.md)
- See `next_prompt.md` for ready-to-copy task prompt
- Model IDs for GPT-OSS-120B and GLM 4.7 need verification on OpenRouter
